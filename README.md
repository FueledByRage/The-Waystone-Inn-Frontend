> **_NOTE_** This version is no long getting updates. I've migrated the project to Vite and you can find the new version (here)[https://github.com/FueledByRage/the-waystone-inn-front-vite]
# About it:
This is suposed to be a forum reddit based. It's get basic features as create a profile, communities, posts and comments.
The name and color palett have been choosen afte one of my favourites fantasy literary saga (The Kingkiller Chronicle) and his main character.

# Why:
Instead of making a simple CRUD for my portfolio this is my attempt to a more interesting and challeging aplication.

# Observation
It's UI is quite poor yet since design is not my comfort zone and it's in a early development stage.
