# The Waystone Inn

# About it:
This is suposed to be a forum reddit based. It's get basic features as create a profile, communities, posts and comments.
The name and color palett have been choosen afte one of my favourites fantasy literary saga (The Kingkiller Chronicle) and his main character.
[API](https://github.com/FueledByRage/The-Waystone-Inn-Backend)

# Why:
Instead of making a simpler CRUD for my portfolio this is my attempt to a more interesting and challeging aplication.

# Observation
It's UI is quite poor since frontend is not my comfort zone and it's in a early development stage.
